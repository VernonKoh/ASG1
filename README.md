# LUGATTI

I would be creating a car company website based on **BUGGATI** but i would change its name to **LUGATTI** :+1:

**Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories.**

The website would contain information about the car **Specifications**, **Models** and **News** about the car. This would help users understand about the car even better.

### Design Process :rocket:
------------------
This website is for people that are interested in buying a **Luggati** car, we would show attractive pictures of the car so that people who visit the website would automatically be attracted to stay and check out the different kinds of car available.


**What kind of interactions i would like to have on my website**
* Im going to have a Menu selection so user can choose what they would want to view
    * Contact section
    * Car Models
    * Lugatti Clothings
    * Purchase Luggati
