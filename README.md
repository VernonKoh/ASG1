# LUGGATI

I would be creating a car company website based on **BUGGATI** but i would change its name to **LUGGATI** :+1:

The website would contain information about the car **Specifications**, **Models** and **News** about the car. This would help users understand about the car even better.

### Design Process :rocket:
------------------
This website is for people that are interested in buying a **Luggati** car, we would show attractive pictures of the car so that people who visit the website would automatically be attracted to stay and check out the different kinds of car available.



**What kind of interactions i would like to have on my website**
* Im going to have a Menu selection so user can choose what they would want to view
    * Contact section
    * Car Models
    * Luggati Clothings
    * Purchase Luggati
* this would allow users to find the things that they want to look at easily
